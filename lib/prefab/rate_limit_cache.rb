  # A key-based rate limiter that considers a key to be fresh if it has been
  # seen within the last `duration` seconds.
  #
  # This is used to rate limit the number of times we send a given context
  # to the server.
  #
  # Because expected usage is to immediately `set` on a `fresh?` miss, we do
  # not prune the data structure on `fresh?` calls. Instead, we manually invoke
  # `prune` periodically from the cache consumer.
