Ruby Client for Prefab Feature Flags, Dynamic log levels, and Config as a Service: https://www.prefab.cloud

```ruby
client = Prefab::Client.new

lookup_key = "user-123"
identity_attributes = {
  team_id: 432,
  user_id: 123,
  subscription_level: 'pro',
  email: "alice@example.com"
}

result = client.enabled? "my-first-feature-flag", lookup_key, identity_attributes

puts "my-first-feature-flag is: #{result} for #{lookup_key}"
```
See full documentation https://docs.prefab.cloud/docs/ruby-sdk/ruby

## Supports

* Feature Flags
* Dynamic log levels
* Live Config
* WebUI for tweaking config, log levels, and feature flags

## Important note about Forking and realtime updates

Many ruby web servers fork. When the process is forked, the current realtime update stream is disconnected. If you're using Puma or Unicorn, do the following.

```ruby
#config/initializers/prefab.rb
$prefab = Prefab::Client.new
$prefab.set_rails_loggers
```

```ruby
#puma.rb
on_worker_boot do
  $prefab = Prefab::Client.new
  $prefab.set_rails_loggers
end
```

```ruby
# unicorn.rb
after_fork do |server, worker|
  $prefab = Prefab::Client.new(options)
  $prefab.set_rails_loggers
end
```

## Logging & Debugging
In classpath or ~/.prefab.default.config.yaml set

```
log-level:
  cloud.prefab: debug
```

To debug issues before this config file has been read, set env var
```
PREFAB_LOG_CLIENT_BOOTSTRAP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## Contributing to prefab-cloud-ruby

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
