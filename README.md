# prefab-cloud-ruby

Ruby Client for Prefab Feature Flags, Dynamic log levels, and Config as a Service: https://www.prefab.cloud

```ruby
client = Prefab::Client.new

context = {
  user: {
    team_id: 432,
    id: 123,
    subscription_level: 'pro',
    email: "alice@example.com"
  }
}

result = client.enabled? "my-first-feature-flag", context

puts "my-first-feature-flag is: #{result}"
```

See full documentation https://docs.prefab.cloud/docs/sdks/ruby

## Supports

- Feature Flags
- Dynamic log levels
- Live Config
- WebUI for tweaking config, log levels, and feature flags

## Important note about Forking and realtime updates

Many ruby web servers fork. When the process is forked, the current realtime update stream is disconnected. If you're using Puma or Unicorn, do the following.

```ruby
#config/application.rb
Prefab.init # reads PREFAB_API_KEY env var by default
```

```ruby
#puma.rb
on_worker_boot do
  Prefab.fork
end
```

```ruby
# unicorn.rb
after_fork do |server, worker|
  Prefab.fork
end
```

## Logging & Debugging

To use dynamic logging, we recommend [semantic logger]. Add semantic_logger to your Gemfile and then we'll configure our app to use it.

### Plain ol' Ruby

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "semantic_logger"
```

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"
require "prefab"

Prefab.init

SemanticLogger.sync!
SemanticLogger.default_level = :trace # Prefab will take over the filtering
SemanticLogger.add_appender(
  io: $stdout,
  formatter: :json,
  filter: Prefab.log_filter,
)
```

### With Rails

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "amazing_print"
gem "rails_semantic_logger"
```

```ruby
# config/application.rb
Prefab.init

# config/initializers/logging.rb
SemanticLogger.sync!
SemanticLogger.default_level = :trace # Prefab will take over the filtering
SemanticLogger.add_appender(
  io: $stdout,
  formatter: Rails.env.development? ? :color : :json,
  filter: Prefab.log_filter,
)
```

```ruby
#puma.rb
on_worker_boot do
    SemanticLogger.reopen
    Prefab.fork
end
```

## Contributing to prefab-cloud-ruby

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
- Fork the project.
- Start a feature/bugfix branch.
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
